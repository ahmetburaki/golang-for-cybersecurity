# Keylogger

This keylogger is used to monitor key presses and save them to a text file. The program runs on the Windows operating system.

## How it Works

1. It creates a text file named `result.txt` and saves key presses to this file.

2. It listens for key presses in an infinite loop and captures them.

3. It determines the corresponding English character or special key code for the key presses and writes them to the `result.txt` file.

4. The program adds a 1-second delay between each key press.

## Requirements

- This program requires the Windows operating system to run.
- A working compiler for the Go programming language is required.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
Clone this repository or download the Go source code file.
cd keylogger
go build
./keylogger
```
You can find the key presses in a text file named result.txt.
