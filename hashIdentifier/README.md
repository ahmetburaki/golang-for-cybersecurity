# Hash Algorithm Detection Program

This Go program is used to detect which hash algorithm was used to generate a given hash value by comparing it against various hash algorithms.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. The program will prompt you to enter a hash value.
3. Enter the hash value and press Enter.
4. The program will attempt to determine which hash algorithm was used.
5. You will see the result on the screen.
